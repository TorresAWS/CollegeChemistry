Density of a solution--often expressed in g/mL--is the ratio of the grams of solution and the mL of solution.
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \text{d}=\frac{\text{grams of solution}}{\text{mL of solution}} }\label{\chapterlabel:equation6}
\end{equation}
Density can be used to convert the mass of solution into the volume of solution, of the opposite. In the case of pure water, the density of water is 1g/mL that is the mass in grams of water equals its volume in mL.
