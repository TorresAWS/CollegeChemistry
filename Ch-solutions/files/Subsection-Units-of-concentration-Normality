Normality is another way to express concentration. It is used for acid, bases, oxidizing, or reducing agents.  \emph{Normality} is defined as the number of equivalents per liter of solution and is related to molarity
\[  N=n_{eq}\cdot M   \]
where $M$ is molarity and $n_{eq}$ is the number of equivalents. Still, the definition of an equivalent changes based on the species in solution. For an acid-base reagent, the number of equivalents is the number of protons or hydroxyls an acid or base can produce. For example, for \ce{H2SO4} $n_{eq}$ is 2 and for \ce{H3PO4} $n_{eq}$ is 3. Therefore, a 1M solution of \ce{H2SO4} will be 2 normal.
For redox reactions, the equivalent is defined as the quantity of redox agents that can exchange one mole of electrons. For example, permanganate exchanges 5$e^{-}$ during redox reaction based in the reaction below:

\begin{center}\ce{ MnO_4^{-} +  5e^{-} +  8H^{+} -> Mn^{2+} + 4H_2O}\end{center}
therefore 1M solution of \ce{KMnO_4} will be 5 normal. When dealing with normality, historically one speaks about the \emph{equivalent mass} or equivalent weight of a reagent, defined as the molar mass divided by the number of equivalents.
