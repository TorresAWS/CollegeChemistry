When you prepare a solution you normally weigh a given amount of solute and add some volume of solvent. That will give you a given concentration that you can compute in terms of for example molarity. Often, you encounter a solution already prepared, for example, a 2M solution and you need to know a different type of concentration unit, such as its molality. That is why relating concentration units is important. In the next sections, we will cover how the different concentration units are related. Figure \label{Fig:Figure-diagram-molarity-molalilty-new} displays all formulas used to relate different units of concentration.
