Every liquid exerts a certain vapor pressure that depends on temperature. The molecules on the surface of the liquid are less tied than the molecules of the interior part of the liquid called the bulk. As such, they can escape producing what we call the vapor pressure of the liquid. Solutions exert lower vapor pressure than pure solvents. The vapor-pressure lowering is a colligative property that depends on the solute mole fraction:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ P_{vap}^{\text{solution}}=P_{vap}^{\text{solvent}} -  \chi \cdot P_{vap}^{\text{solvent}} 	}
\quad  \text{or }\quad 
\boxed{\Delta P_{vap}^{\text{solution}} =  -  \chi \cdot P_{vap}^{\text{solvent}}  }
\label{\chapterlabel:equation12}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $P_{vap}^{\text{solution}}$  is the vapor pressure of the solution
 \item $P_{vap}^{\text{solvent}}$  is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent
  \item $\chi$   is the solute mole fraction 
  \item $\Delta P_{vap}^{\text{solution}} $, a negative value, is the vapor-pressure lowering, that is, $P_{vap}^{\text{solution}}-P_{vap}^{\text{solvent}}$
\end{where}
For example, the vapor pressure of water at 25$^{\circ}$C  is 0.03 atm. If we make a solution with a 0.5 solute mole fraction by adding table salt to the water, the vapor pressure of this solution would be 0.015 atm. In other words, the vapor pressure is lower than the one from pure water.  Equation \ref{\chapterlabel:equation12} is called Raoult's Law.
Raoult's Law establishes a linear relationship between the vapor pressure of a solution and the mole fraction in which the slope of the relationship gives the vapor pressure of the pure solvent, the $x$ variable is $1-\chi$ and the $y$ variable is $P_{vap}^{\text{solution}}$. Simply put, by plotting $P_{vap}^{\text{solution}}$ vs. $1-\chi$ we obtain a straight line with a slope equals to $P_{vap}^{\text{solution}}$.
