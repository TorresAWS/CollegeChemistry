We can use the following formula to relate mole fraction and percent by mass of solute
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \chi=\frac{18\cdot  \%_{m}  }{100\cdot MW + (18-MW)\cdot \%_{m} }}
\quad  \text{or }\quad 
\boxed{ \%_{m}=\frac{ 100\cdot MW\cdot \chi  }{ 18+(MW-18)\chi }}
\label{\chapterlabel:equation9}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $\chi$   is the solute mole fraction
  \item $\%_m$   is the solute percent by mass  
  \item $MW$   is the molecular weight of the solute 
  \item 18 is the molar weight of water
\end{where}
Mind that this formula only works for water as a solvent. If using a different solvent you just need to update the $18$ value and use the molar weight of the new solvent instead.
