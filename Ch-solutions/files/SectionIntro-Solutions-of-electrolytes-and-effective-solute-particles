Chemicals can be classified based on their electrolyte character in strong electrolytes and non-electrolytes. Non-electrolytes do not dissociate in solution so each non-electrolyte molecule becomes a solute particle. Differently, strong electrolytes dissociate in solution so that each strong electrolyte molecule gives more than one solute particle. This section covers the concept of effective solute particles and the idea of Van't Hoff factor $i$ that relates the amount of moles of solute dissolved and the moles of solute particles.
