Pressure has no impact on the solubility of solids or liquids in a liquid solvent. However, gas pressure has an impact on the solubility of a gas solute on a liquid at a fixed temperature. In particular, the higher pressure the higher solubility. The law that related gas solubility with pressure is called Henry's law:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ s=k\cdot P 	}
\label{\chapterlabel:equation14}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $s$  is the solubility of a gas in a liquid solvent in M units
 \item $k$  is Henry's law constant with units of M/atm
  \item $P $ is the gas pressure in atm
\end{where}
Henry's law constant is $k$ characteristic of a solution at a fixed temperature. This law is obeyed for very diluted solutions of gases that do not dissociate or react with water (e.g. \ce{O_2} in water). For example, \ce{HCl_{(g)}} does not follow this law as it can dissociate in water.
An everyday life application of Henry's law is the production of carbonated beverages. These beverages are produced by exposing a liquid to an atmosphere of gas \ce{CO2} with typical pressures of 5 atm. When you open a can container, the \ce{CO2} in the drink comes out of the liquid in the form of bubbles to equilibrate the high gas pressure on the liquid and the low gas pressure in the atmosphere.
