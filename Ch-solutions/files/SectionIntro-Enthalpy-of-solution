Some chemicals favorably mix. For example, table salt dissolves in water, and oil mixes with cyclohexane. Others, such as water and cyclohexane, do not mix. \emph{Like dissolves likes} is the rule behind miscibility. Understanding why chemicals mix at the molecular level is the key to understanding solubility. Thermodynamics can give some insight into why chemicals mix. In particular, an enthalpy analysis of mixing, and understanding the energy effects involved in solubility can give some partial insight into solubility. Still, it is important to acknowledge that energetics--energy considerations--is only part of the answer, and the effect of the spreading of energy--also known as Entropic effects--have to be included in this analysis to achieve a complete picture of solubility.
