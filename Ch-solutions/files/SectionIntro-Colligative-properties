Colligative properties of solutions are properties that depend on the concentration of solute but not on the nature of this solute. In the following, we will elaborate more on the idea of colligative properties. Indeed, there are four colligative properties of the solutions: the freezing point depression, the boiling point elevation, the osmotic pressure, and the vapor pressure. Mind that these are all properties of solutions and not of pure substances. Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Colligative-properties-phase-diagram}  displays the effect of the solute concentration on the phase diagram of water.
