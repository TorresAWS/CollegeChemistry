The solute concentration impacts the movement of water in and out of the animal and vegetal cells. This important process is called osmosis. Osmosis occurs when two solutions of different concentrations--a more concentrated and a more diluted solution--are connected using a semipermeable membrane, that is a membrane that only allows the movement of small water molecules. Osmosis refers to the flow of water through a semipermeable membrane, from the most diluted to the most concentrated solution. The flow follows a gradient of osmotic pressure from the most diluted solution with lower osmotic pressure to the most concentrated with a larger osmotic pressure. Water molecules flow to reduce the concentration of the most concentrated solution and hence to minimize the difference in concentration across the semipermeable membrane. Due to the flow of liquid, the liquid level of the most concentrated side rises and the level of the most diluted side decreases.

In a process called \emph{reverse osmosis}, an external pressure is applied to a concentrated solution in contact with a container of pure solvent in order to force the reverse flow of water against the concentration gradient. This way solutions drie up while solvent transfers out of it. This principle is applied in desalination plants that obtain pure water from salty water. Still, the pressure applied is so much that this process is not economically feasible in most parts of the world.
