\subsection*{Part A. Getting started: standardize the conductimeter}
\begin{steps}
  	\newstep[] Install the conductivity meter. The probe of the instrument is immersed in a clean solution that must be kept aside until the end of the experiment. Mind the probe needs to be hydrated at all times.
  	\newstep[] To calibrate the conductivity meter, place 40mL of standard conductivity solution in a 50mL beaker while placing the probe in it. 
\newstep[]  Now press Setup (top right menu). Normal setups are: cell constant of 1.0, standard recognition with manual selected, reference temperature 25 degrees, temperature coefficient of 2.1\%, and alarm limits off. 
\newstep[] Now press Standardize (top right menu) and input 0.999 mS/cm in the keypad and press confirm (this should be the conductivity value of the standard). Finally, press Confirm (top right menu) to save the standard value. Now you are ready to measure.

\subsection*{Part A. Getting started: measuring conductivity}
 \newstep[] It is very important to follow some cleaning steps before you measure the conductivity of any solution. You will need a 100 mL beaker labeled as waste, a wash bottle, and a 250 mL beaker with distilled water.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Rinse the probe using the wash bottle over the waste beaker.
\item Dip the probe 3-4 times into the 250 mL beaker with clean distilled water.
\item Dip the probe into the solution to be measured. Use a 50 mL beaker (or a jumbo test tube) with at least 25 mL of solution. Use the same volume for all conductivity measurements.
\item Repeat cleaning steps 1 and 2.
\end{enumerate}
