When solving the equation below for $x$ 
\[ 3x-4 = 7	\]
some basic algebra rules apply:

\begin{solutionbox} \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\color{white}\arabic*}]
\item \begin{bf}Step one:\end{bf}  Place all like terms in one side
 \item \begin{bf}Step two:\end{bf} Isolate the variable you want to calculate
\item \begin{bf}Step three:\end{bf} Check the answer
  \end{enumerate} 
\end{solutionbox}
When placing like terms on the same side, you can eliminate terms by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing. Make sure you apply those rules on both sides of the equation at the same time. For the example above, we will first eliminate the $-4$ by subtracting $4$ in both sides:
\[ 3x-\cancel{4}+\cancel{4} = 7+4	\]
That gives,
\[ 3x = 12	\]
Now we will remove the $3$ by diving by three on both sides:
\[ \frac{\cancel{3}x}{\cancel{3}}  = \frac{12}{3} 	\]
Therefore we have
\[ x = \frac{12}{3}=4 	\]
