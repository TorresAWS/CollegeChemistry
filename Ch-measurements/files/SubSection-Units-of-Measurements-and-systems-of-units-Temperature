How is the weather today? Is it cold or hot? You use a thermometer to measure temperature and for example assess  an object is, or how cold it is outside, or perhaps to determine if you have a fever.  Temperature tells us how hot or cold an object is. Temperature can be measured in numerous units such as Celsius ($^{\circ}$C), Fahrenheit ($^{\circ}$F), or kelvins (K).
