The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) publishes many books which contain its complete list of definitions and rules. The definitions are divided initially into seven IUPAC Colour Books: Gold, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange, White, and Red.
Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, commonly referred to by chemists as the Blue Book, is a collection of recommendations on organic chemical nomenclature published at irregular intervals. Here we will follow those recomendations in order to name hydrocarbon derivatives.
Hydrocarbon derivatives are organic molecules with a hydrocarbon base and extra functional groups. Examples are alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids. All those contain a hydrocarbon skeleton with some functional group. This section covers the naming rules for these chemicals.
