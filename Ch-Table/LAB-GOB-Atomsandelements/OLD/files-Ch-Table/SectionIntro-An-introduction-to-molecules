The periodic table contains all elements in nature. At the same time, elements combine to form molecules. For example, in the air there are traces of Argon--this is an element--and also water, a molecule (\ce{H2O}) that results from the combination of two elements, hydrogen (\ce{H}) and oxygen (\ce{O}). This section will first introduce some of the properties of molecules, without paying attention to their chemical names that will covered in the following chapters.
