 The physical and chemical properties of some elements of the table are similar, and these similarities led to the organization of the periodic table. Elements in the same group share properties and for example, oxygen and sulfur have similar properties: both are reactive elements. Differently, the properties across periods change going from metals to nonmetals. For example, the properties of Li and Ne are very different and lithium is a reactive metal whereas neon is a nonreactive gas.
