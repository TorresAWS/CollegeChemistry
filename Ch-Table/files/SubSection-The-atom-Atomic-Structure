An atom is an electrically neutral, spherical entity made of a nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. Atoms contain three atomic particles: the proton, neutron, and electron. Protons have a positive charge (\ce{+}), whereas electrons carry a negative charge (\ce{-}). Both electrons and protons have the same charge in magnitude but with opposite signs. 
Neutrons on the other hand are neutral, and they have no electrical charge. Protons and neutrons are located in the core of the atom, which is called the nucleus, and account for the mass of the atom. The only exception is the hydrogen atom, the smallest element, with just one proton in the nucleus.
Electrons are delocalized in the exterior part of the atoms. They are not necessarily located in a specific spot and their existence spreads in the area next to the nucleus. Electrons move rapidly being spread and held by nuclear attraction. Atoms are neutral without a charge as the number of electrons and protons are the same. Some atoms have a positive charge, resulting from removing electron density, and we call these cations. Others--called anions--can have a negative charge as a result of accepting negative electron density.
The mass of a proton or neutron is 2000 times larger than the mass of an electron and the atom's diameter is more than 10000 times the diameter of its nucleus. The nucleus is very dense being 99\% of an atom's mass while occupying a small volume.
