 The physical and chemical properties of some elements of the table (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-The-periodic-table}) are similar, and these similarities led to the organization of the table. Elements in the same group share properties and for example, oxygen and sulfur have similar properties: both are reactive elements. Differently, the properties across periods change going from metals to nonmetals. For example, the properties of Li and Ne are very different, and lithium is a reactive metal whereas neon is a nonreactive gas.
