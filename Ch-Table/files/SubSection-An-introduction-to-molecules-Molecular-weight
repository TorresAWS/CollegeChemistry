Here are two examples of molecules: molecular oxygen \ce{O2} and molecular nitrogen \ce{N2}. How do we interpret these formulas? The subscript "2" indicates that each molecule contains two atoms. For example, a \ce{O2} molecule is made of two oxygen atoms \ce{O}. At the same time, the weight of a set of molecules is called the molecular weight (MW). However, you will find different terms refering to the same property (e.g. molecular mass, molar mass, or formula unit mass). All these terms indeed mean the weight of a large set of molecules. We can calculate the MW by adding the weight of each atom that forms the molecule taking into account the number of atoms of each element present in the molecule. The units of molecular weight are the same as the units of atomic weight: amu, atomic mass units.
