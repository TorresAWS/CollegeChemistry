 How do we know that hydrogen produces a \ce{H+} ion and nitrogen a \ce{N^{3-}} anion? The charge of an ion is called an ionic charge, and the numbers are coming from the periodic table. H, Na, or K are in group IA (left of the table) and hence the ionic charge will be $1+$.  Similarly, Mg or Ca are in group IIA (left of the table) and hence the ionic charge will be $2+$. Differently, F, Cl, or Br are in group 7A (right of the table) and their charge will be $1-$. Oxygen is in group 6A (right of the table) and the ionic charge will be $2-$. Figure \ref{Fig:{\chapterlabel}\thefigurenewcounter} contains all ionic charges. What if the element is not on this list such as in the case of Iron (Fe)? In that case, very probably it will have several ionic charges and this charge has to be indicated in the chemical name. An example would be \ce{Fe}, which ionic charge is not in Figure \ref{Fig:{\chapterlabel}\thefigurenewcounter} as iron can have several ionic charges.
