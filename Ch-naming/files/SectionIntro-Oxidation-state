Isolated atoms tend to have a  neutral charge. However, the atoms of elements have the capacity of gaining and losing electron density forming cations and anions. The atoms that form a compound can have different charge states resulting in losing and gaining electronic charge. We refer to this as the oxidation state of an element in a compound.
