In this section, we will learn how to name acids and bases. Acids normally have common names (e.g. sulfuric acid) and their naming does not follow modern rules. Names and formulas of acids are commonly tabulated due to historical reasons. Differently, bases (e.g. sodium hydroxide) are named in a standard way.
