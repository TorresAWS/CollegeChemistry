\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}A}{ll} elements in the periodic table except for the noble gases--He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Rn--combine to produce chemical compounds. Most of these chemicals are useful in your everyday life, and you drink water to quench your thirst, use Clorox to clean your house, or baking soda to get rid of a stinky refrigerator. In this chapter you will learn not only how to name these chemicals but also read chemical formulas--we call this to formulate chemicals. Still, chemical elements such as hydrogen and oxygen do not combine randomly and they only choose specific elemental partners to form a compound. As an example, hydrogen combines with oxygen using specific proportions to produce \ce{H2O} and not \ce{HO2}. In this chapter, you will also learn the rules that chemical elements use to combine.
