At this point, we saw the naming and formulation of ionic (e.g. \ce{NaCl}) and covalent compounds (e.g. \ce{CO2}). This section covers the naming of complex salts: oxosalts and hydrosalts. In general, salts (oxosalts or hydrosalts) are the result of mixing an oxoacid and a base. Their formulas tend to look more complex than simple ionic or covalent compounds as they are made of at least three different elements. An example of an oxosalt would be \ce{CaSO4} called calcium carbonate. An example of hydrosalt would be \ce{NaHSO4} which is called sodium monohydrosulfate. This section will also cover the naming of hydrates (e.g. \ce{CaSO4 . H2O}), which are compounds containing water molecules inside their structure. Before being able to name these complex chemicals it is convenient to practice combining ions, without paying attention to the chemical naming.
