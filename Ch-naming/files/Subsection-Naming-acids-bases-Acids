 Acids--in particular inorganic acids--are chemicals that normally contain hydrogen at the beginning of their formula. For example, \ce{HCl} or \ce{H2SO4}. \ce{HCl} is a hydracid and is named as \begin{it}hydrochloric acid\end{it}, whereas  \ce{H2SO4} is an oxoacid that contains oxygen named as \begin{it}sulfuric acid\end{it}.
The names of acids are not standard and they come from common names employed in the field for many years. Table \ref{tab:{\chapterlabel}\thetablenewcounter} contains a list of the most important oxoacids and hydracids.
