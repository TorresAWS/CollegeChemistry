\ce{NaCl} results from the combination of \ce{Na^+} and \ce{Cl^-}. The ionic charges of Na and Cl are given in Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Valences} according to the group. If the ionic chemical contains a transition metal with variable ionic charge, that is, which is not in Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Valences} then the ionic naming becomes a bit more complex. The reason is that one needs to specify the charge of the metal, explicitly in the name of the chemical. An example would be \ce{NiCl2} named as Nickel(II) chloride or  \ce{Co2O3} named as Cobalt(III) oxide.
