 This section covers how to name ionic chemicals containing a metal with variable charge. In this case, you need to specify the charge of the metal in the name. To calculate this number you will solve a simple math equation. For example, the name of \ce{Mn2O3} is Manganese(III) oxide. How do we get this name? Manganese has several charges as it is not in Figure \ref{Fig:{\chapterlabel}\thefigurenewcounter}, let us use x for its charge \ce{Mn^x} and oxygen has a charge of two \ce{O^{2-}}. After combining \ce{Mn^x} and \ce{O^{2-}} the resulting formula would be  \ce{Mn2Ox}. By comparison with the given formula, \ce{Mn2O3}, x has to be three and hence the charge of Mn has to be three. Therefore, the final name would be Manganese(III) oxide.
