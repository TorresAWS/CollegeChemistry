The importance of the oxidation state of the central elements of oxoacid results from the fact that acids with high or low oxidation states, tend to be very reactive, sometimes capable of completely dissolving metals. We call this oxidizing (or reducing) acids. For example, \ce{HNO3} and \ce{H2SO4} are both oxidizing acids, and these acids will solve for example a piece of copper. Similarly, acids with very small or negative oxidation numbers can be very reactive as well. These acids are called reducing acids or agents.
Let us compare two oxoacids to elaborate more on the terminology used to describe redox numbers. For example, let us compare \ce{H\underline{Cl\textsuperscript{V}}O3} and \ce{H\underline{Cl\textsuperscript{III}}O2}. 
We say  Cl on \ce{H\underline{Cl\textsuperscript{V}}O3} has a larger redox number than \ce{H\underline{Cl\textsuperscript{III}}O2}. We can also say, Cl in \ce{H\underline{Cl\textsuperscript{V}}O3} is more oxidized than Cl on \ce{H\underline{Cl\textsuperscript{III}}O2}. 
Finally, we can also say, \ce{H\underline{Cl\textsuperscript{V}}O3} is more reducing than \ce{H\underline{Cl\textsuperscript{III}}O2}. Again, the terms associated with high redox numbers are oxidized and reducing, and the terms associated with low redox numbers are reduced and oxidizing.

It is important to note that the oxidation state of an element is ultimately related to the amount of electron density--electronic charge--of that element. The more electronic charge the smaller--the more negative--the oxidation state. In other words, large oxidation states result from losing electron density.
