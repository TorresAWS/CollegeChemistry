Some oxosalts contain hydrogen atoms in their structure between the oxosalt cation and anion (e.g. \ce{NaHSO4}). For example, \ce{NaHSO4} is named sodium monohydrogensulfate. To understand this name, we will first focus on the second part of the name, monohydrogensulfate which represents the anion.
The name monohydrogensulfate (\ce{HSO4^{-}}) comes from adding a proton (\ce{H^+}) to a sulfate cation (\ce{SO4^{2-}}). Mind that protons (\ce{H^+}) are positively charged and therefore if we add a single \ce{H^+} to a sulfate cation (\ce{SO4^{2-}}) the charge will have to decrease a single unit, giving us \ce{HSO4^{-}}. As we can see, the name is directly related to the oxosalt anion and the number of hydrogens in the hydrosalt name. For example, phosphate (\ce{PO4^{3-}}) is an oxosalt anion whereas hydrogenphosphate (\ce{HPO4^{2-}}) and dihydrogenphosphate (\ce{H2PO4^{-}}) are both hydrosalt anions. An explanation about the charges: as phosphate has three negative charges, hydrogenphosphate has to have one less charge (that is $2-$) and dihydrogenphosphate has to have two less negative charges (that is $-1$). Some final hydrosalt anions examples:
 \begin{namingbox} {}
  carbonate 	\hfill\ce{CO3^{-2}}({\small oxosalt ion}) \\
  monohydrogen carbonate 	\hfill \ce{HCO3^{-}}({\small hydrosalt ion}) \\


%\hfill   \ce{HCO3^{-}}\hfill monohydrogen carbonate ({\small hydrosalt})\\
  %  \ce{BO3^{-3}}\hfill borate ({\small oxosalt})	\hfill   \ce{H2BO3^{-}}\hfill dihydrogen borate ({\small hydrosalt}) 
\end{namingbox}
Above we saw how to name just the ending of the oxosalt with hydrogen anion. Now we can move forward to the whole naming of the salt. We just need to add the name of the element in the first place, and for example, \ce{NaH2BO3} would be named sodium dihydrogenborate. If the first ion--the cation--is a transition metal cation (a type two cation) we need to include in parenthesis the valence of the cation. For example, \ce{Fe(H2BO3)2} would be named iron(II) dihydrogenborate. More examples:
 \begin{namingbox} {}
  sodium carbonate \hfill\ce{Na2CO3}({\small oxosalt})   \\	\hfill  sodium monohydrogen carbonate \hfill  \ce{NaHCO3}  ({\small hydrosalt})\\
%    \ce{Mn3(BO3)2}\hfill Manganese(II) borate 	\hfill   \ce{Mn(H2BO3)2}\hfill Manganese(II) dihydrogenborate ({\small hydrosalt}) 
\end{namingbox}
