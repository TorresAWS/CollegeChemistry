Atoms of an ionic compound are connected through an ionic bond. In an ionic bond, one element gives away (the cation) and the other one receives electron density (the anion). As an example, in the \ce{NaCl} molecule Na gives away electron density to Cl, and the molecule results from the combinations of \ce{Na^+} and \ce{Cl^+}. In an ionic compound, the element on the left is positive and the one on the right is negative.
