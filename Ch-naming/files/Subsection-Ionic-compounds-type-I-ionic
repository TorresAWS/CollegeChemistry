 Type I ionic compounds result from the combination of a metal with given valence (Li, Ca, Mg, etc, see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Valences} ) and a nonmetal. To name an ionic compound (type I ionic) you need to (a) use the name of the first element in the compound, (b) use the first syllable of the second element, and (c) finish the name of the molecule in the suffix \emph{-ide}. As an example, the formula \ce{NaCl} is named sodium chloride, and  \ce{MgCl_2} is named magnesium chloride. Another example would be:
 \begin{namingbox} {}
  calcium chloride\hfill \ce{CaCl2} (\small ionic)
 % \ce{CaCl2}\hfill calcium chloride 	\hfill   \ce{LiO2} \hfill lithium oxide  \\
\end{namingbox}
To formulate an ionic compound from a given name, we need to combine both ions by exchanging the valences (the ionic charges). For example, \ce{MgCl_2} results from the combination of \ce{Mg^{2+}} and \ce{Cl^{-}} so that the number 2 in \ce{MgCl_2} near the Cl atom is coming from the \ce{Mg^{2+}}. In other words:

  \schemestart
    \chemfig{@{d1}Mg^{2+} }  \hspace{1cm}  \chemfig{+}\hspace{1cm}   \chemfig{2@{d2}Cl^{-}}   \arrow \ce{MgCl2}
  \schemestop
  \chemmove{

      \draw[elmove=left]   (d1) ..controls +(45:1cm) and +(-45:2cm) .. (d2) ;
  }\end{center}\vspace{.5cm}



The sign of the charges only indicates which element goes first in the formula: the positive element (cation) first followed by the negative element (anion). For example, the result of combining \ce{Na^{+}} and \ce{Cl^{-}} is \ce{NaCl} and not \ce{ClNa} as Na has a positive ionic charge and has to appear first in the formula.
