Atoms gain and lose electron density to produce ions. An ion is just an atom with a positive or negative charge. Ions result from an electron density transfer. Positive ions have lost negatively charged electron density, whereas negative ions have gained electron density. The reason for this electronic transfer is that atoms try to achieve a very stable electronic configuration with eight electrons in the valence, and this is called the octet electron configuration. Examples of ions are: \ce{H+}, \ce{Ca^{2+}} or \ce{O^{2-}}. This section covers the properties of ions and ionic charges.
