All the chemicals on this example contain a metal that can have several charges, and hence, we need to specify the ionic charge on the name. \ce{MnO} results from  \ce{Mn^x} and  \ce{O^{2-}}. After combining the ions, the formula would be  \ce{Mn2Ox}, a formula that needs to be compared to  \ce{MnO}. The formulas do not look similar, so lets make them more similar by dividing by two so that \ce{MnO$\frac{x}{2}$} resembles \ce{MnO}. By comparing x has to be 2 and hence the name is Manganese(II) oxide. The name for \ce{Fe3N2}  would be Iron(II) nitride. The valence of Iron comes from combining  \ce{Fe^x} and  \ce{N^{3-}} that gives \ce{Fe3Nx}. By comparison with \ce{Fe3N2}  x has to be two and the name is Iron(II) nitride. the formula for Cobalt(II) carbide would be  \ce{Co2C} as Cobalt(II) is \ce{Co^{2+}} and carbide is \ce{C^{4-}}. After combining the ions one obtains   \ce{Co4C2} that gives \ce{Co2C}. Finally, the formula for Iron(II) oxide is \ce{FeO} as Iron(II) is \ce{Fe^{2+}} and oxide is \ce{O^{2-}} that gives \ce{Fe2O2} and simplifying one obtains \ce{FeO}.\\
