Name or formulate the following ionic compounds: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  \ce{MgO}   % 
\item  \ce{Mg3N2} % 
\item Lithium nitride
\item Magnesium carbide
\end{inparaenum}
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
The name for  \ce{MgO}  is magnesium oxide. \ce{Mg3N2} is called magnesium nitride. The formula for Lithium nitride is \ce{Li3N} and the formula for Magnesium carbide is \ce{Mg2C}, result of simplifying \ce{Mg4C2} dividing by two, the smallest number.\\
