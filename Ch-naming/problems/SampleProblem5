\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Name or formulate the following covalent chemicals: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  \ce{NO }   % 
\item  \ce{CS2 }  % 
\item Sulfur Dioxide
\item Nitrogen Trichloride
\end{inparaenum}
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
All chemicals in this example are covalent as they result of the combination of nonmetals. In order to name them, we need to use prefixes and finish the sufix with -ide. The first chemical is called nitrogen monoxide. \ce{CS2 } is called carbon disulfide. The formula for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen trichoride are respectively  \ce{SO2 } and  \ce{NCl3}.\\
